# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m D Prajagar
ðŸ‘€ Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m passionate about exploring new things through coding, and I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## ðŸŒ± About Me

I am a student eager to learn and experiment with various technologies and programming languages. My interests lie in AI, ML, data science, and software development. I'm always looking for exciting projects and challenges that push my boundaries.

## ðŸ’¼ Experience


## ðŸš€ Projects

- [BRAIN_TUMOR_SEGMENTATION_OVERLAY](https://github.com/Prajagar/BRAIN_TUMOR_SEGMENTATION_OVERLAY)
  - This repository contains the code and resources for brain tumor detection using the U-Net deep learning architecture with color overlay. The U-Net model is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks, and we have extended it to perform brain tumor segmentation on MRI images. The color overlay is applied to visualize the segmented tumor regions, making it easier to interpret the results.
- [FALL_DETECTION_DEEP_LEARNING](https://github.com/Prajagar/FALL_DETECTION_DEEP_LEARNING)
  - This repository contains the code and resources for fall detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately detect falls from video or image data. The CNN architecture is well-suited for image-based tasks and has been successful in various computer vision applications, including fall detection.
- [Fake_Review](https://github.com/Prajagar/Fake_Review)
  - The main objective of the Fake Review Detection System project is to provide a solution to the problem of fake reviews in the online world.
- [Plant-Disease-Prediction](https://github.com/Prajagar/Plant-Disease-Prediction)
  - Plant Disease detection involves the steps like image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. This paper discussed the methods used for the detection of plant diseases using their leaves images(Using CNN)
